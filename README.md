This online repository includes supplementary material for the Benitez and Parrado (2024) paper on the GENOE index.

The first file is the processed database containing GENOE estimates for the one, five, and ten-year horizons. 
The data was originally structured using O*NET-SOC 2019 codes and then converted to SOC 2018 codes.

Additionally, this repository includes follow-up surveys conducted for one iteration for the five-year horizon, 
using the original O*NET-SOC 2019 codes. Point estimates in these surveys may not perfectly match those in the processed database,
as the database represents the average of 100 iterations, while the follow-up survey is based on only one iteration.
